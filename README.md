# gh-branches-ex-1 - Brief

Awesome Websites have asked you to review their website. They have been having some styling issues and have pointed three major concerns;

1. The menu items in the top menu are not changing on hover. 

2. The layout of the main section is poor and not visulay appealing. 

3. The footer menu is vertical and not horizontal, and the list decoration needs to be removed.

Please review the website and make changes to align with the images given in the reference folder. 

No new HTML tags, classes or IDs will need to be created. 

You will need to create three branches to complete this task. Please follow the following strategy;

1. Changes to the top nav menu should be made on the branch 

    feature/header

2. Changes to the main section should be made on the branch

    feature/main_content

3. Changes to the main section should be made on the branch

    feature/footer

Please do not delete your branches on GitHub after merging

Please keep commits to the revelant website section on the relevant branches, and remember to commit small and often and describe the commit
in the relevant message.
